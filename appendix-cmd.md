# A Primer About Software Engineering
# Appendix: Cmd

Windows Command Prompt (CMD) is a bit tricky. There are less tools available than in Linux (Bash/ ZVS ...), it is less powerful and you cannot directly translate your Linux knowledge. There is a more powerful cousin, called [Powershell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/mt173057.aspx). 

With Powershell you can create objects, functions and use .NET. It is way more powerful than Command Prompt. However calling normal Windows executables from Powershell is not always possible. Also Powershell seems to be generally disabled and is never up-to-date. 

Bottom line, if you write simple scripts CMD is still a good choice. When creating .bat scripts you can consule [Dostips](http://www.dostips.com/) and [SS64 - Command line reference](http://ss64.com/nt/).
