# A Primer About Software Engineering
# Chapter 1: Introduction

Read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466958142&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code). 

## Who this Book is for
Me. I write this book because I want to become a better software engineer. I also want to have a reference where I can look up stuff I forget. However, I still feel that it could be valuable for other people to read this. My goal is to summarize end-to-end software development. From requirements, through development, to testing and build/deploy. But because it is a summary a lot of explanations will be glossed over, leaving only the final result.

## Which other Books are great
* [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1466958142&sr=8-1&keywords=clean+code) is the best coding book.
* [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=J9VWCABBDZAJ1KQ6M7Y0) is still great even though at times it feels outdated. F.ex. the book considers the possibility that a developer does not use version control. 
* [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627/ref=pd_sim_14_20?ie=UTF8&dpID=51fUKOog3VL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR122%2C160_&psc=1&refRID=J9VWCABBDZAJ1KQ6M7Y0)
