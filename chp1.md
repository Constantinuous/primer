# Chapter 1: Good Code

["The only valid measurement is wtf's per minute."](http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m). Bad code also costs quite a bit of money. It takes time to understand it (again). You cannot be productive, because every change has side-effects which also need to be fixed. Finally you get gray hairs, or lose them altogether. So write clean code.

## Definition of Clean Code
* Readable: It tells you a story
* Simple: To understand by humans
* Extendable: Others can alter and extend your code
